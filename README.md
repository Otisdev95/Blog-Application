# BLOG APPLICATION
# A SOCIAL MEDIA BACKEND REST API

<h3>
    Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ in this project, i have built a backend social media rest API with the Create, View, Update, or Delete Users and Blogs functionalities. I also include a Date middleware and a Url Shortner Microservice.
</h3>

<p>
    I built this blog application using NodeJS. I have also used MongoDB as the database to store all my Users, Ulogs and Urls. Finally, i used a the following helpful package from npm:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>nanoid:</b> This small, secure and URL friendly unique ID generator was used to generate the short Urls with custome length (7).</li>
    <li><b>bcrypt</b> This employes the bcrypt hashing algorithm to secure passwords. It is designed to be slow and computationally intensive. This makes it resistant to brute-force attacks and rainbow table attack</li>
</ul>
